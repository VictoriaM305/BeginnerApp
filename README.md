Project 2 - InstaworkAnime
Submitted by: Victoria McKinnie
AnimePost is an app that allows users to share anime-related posts with pictures and captions. The app features user authentication and a post feed where users can browse through and interact with content uploaded by others. This project demonstrates my skills in Swift, Parse, and user interface design with Xcode.
Time spent: 15 hours spent in total
Required Features
The following required functionality is completed:
*  Users see an app icon in the home screen and a styled launch screen.
*  User can register a new account.
*  User can log in with a newly created account.
*  App has a feed of posts when user logs in.
*  User can upload a new post which takes in a picture from the photo library and an optional caption.
*  User is able to log out.
The following optional features are implemented:
*  Users can pull to refresh their feed and see a loading indicator.
*  Users can infinite-scroll in their feed to see past the 10 most recent photos.
*  Users can see location and time of photo upload in the feed.
*  User stays logged in when the app is closed and opened again.
The following additional features are implemented:
*  List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I encountered some challenges while handling the image picker and allowing the app to navigate consistently.
